Our project goal is to deliver an adventure game experience like that of Into the Breach. Users will be dropped into a hub world where they are able to pick their level, party, and party gear and must complete a set of progressively harder levels until they reach a final boss.
The battlefield is an x by x grid, with enemies spawning in on their half of the map first. Players get to place their pieces on the board, then the enemy will make their first move.
During these battles, enemies will target civilian targets (if the objective makes them exist) or party members, leading to either your party or your objectives to take damage if threat is not dealt within the turn. The enemy makes a threat against something, and your party gets a turn to react.
Your party has numerous ways to dispatch enemies. Some classes are specialized in displacement of enemies, whereas some just do damage.
The battle ends when either all the enemies are dead, your party is dead, or the turn timer runs out, but every level has an overwhelming number of enemies, so it is likely that you will lose your party if the enemies are not dispatched efficiently. Party members and party gear can be gained by completing battle objectives or die forever if hp drops to zero.
The player loses if they no longer have any party members to put into battle and beats the game if they reach the end. The idea is that the player learns to play the game better for every time they restart the game.
