# Team-01-project


# Description:
Our project goal is to deliver an adventure game experience like that of Into the Breach. Users will be dropped into a hub world where they are able to pick their level, party, and party gear and must complete a set of progressively harder levels until they reach a final boss.

# DEMO1 
To access the work that has been completed for Demo 1 on February 26, 2019. A zipfile labeled Demo1.zip will be on the repository. Files include: Entity.java, Game.java, GameState.java, HumanPlaer.java, Map.java, MapClass.java, Pieces.java, and Turn.java

# How to compile and run Demo1
Download the GameName.zip and compile Game.java and then run Game

# DEMO2
To access the work that has been completed for Demo 2 on March 12, 2019. A zipfile labeled Demo2.zip will be on the repository. 

# How to compile and run Demo2 console-based
Download all the files in our project github, then open Version2.0, javac it, then do java MetaGame. Make sure the folder named "one" is unzipped and is in the same directory as everything else.

# How to compile and run Demo2 GUI-based
Download all contents in Version1.4.GUI, unzip the contents in the folder "one" (and make sure it's in the same directory as all the files), then compile all files and run the class BoardPanel; (java BoardPanel).

# DEMO3
Download the files and go to the directory for V3.2.MAIN. 
To run the text-based: line 310 in MetaGame should say "level.playText()".
To run the GUI-based: line 310 in MetaGame should say "level.play()".

# How to compile and run Demo2 console-based
Download all contents in V3.2.MAIN, ensure that line 310 in MetaGame says "level.playText()". Compile all the files. Run MetaGame (ie., "java MetaGame"). 
When prompted, you can use option 1 and 2 to create and load maps. However, to immediately play the game press "3". When prompted for level and world, enter "one one". Follow the instructions to play the game.

# How to compile and run Demo2 GUI-based
Download all contents in V3.2.MAIN, ensure that line 310 in MetaGame says "level.play()". Compile all the files. Run BoardPanel (ie., "java BoardPanel"). 
When prompted, click buttons to place the pieces (note that pieces can only be placed in any row that is not the last three rows of the board. Whenever no moves are left in a turn, click the "End turn" button. Note that whenever you move, attack, or heal, you must click the "Update state" button to see the changes.

NOTE: due to a bug, you can't test the attacking in V3.2.MAIN. If you'd like to do so, compile all files in V3.3.MAIN. Run BoardPanel. You don't need to change any lines in MetaGame. (The only reason V3.3.MAIN allows for attacking is because enemies are closer to the first row.)

Lana requests critiques on the event-handling on BoardPanel and advice on how to make the code less messy. Thanks!
