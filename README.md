# SPACE RANCH - Team 01

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Description:
Our project goal is to deliver an adventure game experience like that of Into the Breach. Users will be dropped into a hub world where they are able to pick a level to play. Within each level, their objective is to protect the citizens, the powergrid, and themselves from the monster invasion.

# How to compile and run the game:
1. Download the contents of the repository.
2. Navigate to the folder labeled \<V3.2.MAIN\> and compile all the files.
3. Run the game by typing this command into your console: java Menu

Main menu navigation:

NEW GAME (TEXT) -> closes the window and allows you to play the text-based version on your console.

NEW GAME (GUI) -> opens up a level editor that allows you to create and edit your own levels for the game.

CONTINUE -> skips the level editor and allows you to jump right into world and level select for the GUI-based version of the game. Choose your world and level to get started!

EXIT -> exits the main menu.

# How to compile and run the JUnit:
julien you do this lol

# How to play:
THE OBJECTIVE:
To protect the innocents, the powergrids, and your own team from the enemies. This is to be done after a limited number of turns, and if the innocents are successfully defended by the end of the round, you win!

WORLD AND LEVELS:
This is a hub-world game in that you can choose worlds and levels within to attempt them and the objective to defeat them all with a party of 3. //Beware: once a team member dies, it is not revived for the rest of the rounds.

HOW TO PLAY:
(Button-click instructions only apply for the GUI-based version of the game.)

On the first turn, place your pieces by clicking free tiles. The game will alert you when you're unable to place pieces at a certain spot and at a certain time.

After the first turn, you and an AI will alternate in taking turns until the turn counter reaches 0.

Each piece (ally and enemy) has a limited amount of AP, or action points. A piece cannot do anything once their AP reaches 0. Movement of one tile uses up 1 AP, healing takes up 1 AP, and attacking takes up 2 AP (you may dip into the negatives).

You can view the state of your allies and enemies by clicking the VIEW PARTY and VIEW ENEMIES buttons, respectively. You can also see the tiles of the grid by clicking the SHOW TILES button. To see the pieces once again, click the UPDATE STATE button.

Each piece has a variety of traits: attack, defense, HP, and movement. Use this to your advantage!

To move: click any one of your pieces --> click the MOVE button --> click any free tile that is above, below, to the left, or to the right of your piece (not diagonally) --> click the MOVE button again --> click the UPDATE STATE button.

To attack: click any one of your pieces --> click the ATTACK button --> click any tile occupied by an enemy that is above, below, to the left, or to the right of your piece (not diagonally) --> click the ATTACK button again --> click the UPDATE STATE button.

To heal: click any one of your pieces --> click the HEAL button. You can only heal if you are not at full health.

End your turn whenever your pieces have no AP or when you do not desire to make any moves. Do this by clicking the END TURN button and then the UPDATE STATE button. 

Good luck and have fun!
